# IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER
---
This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
---
## Features
---
* Encryption: Encrypt your messages with a specified shift value.
* Decryption: Decrypt Caesar cipher-encrypted messages with the correct shift value.
* Support for Alphabetic Characters: Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving non-alphabet characters.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for ease of use.
