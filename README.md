# IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER
---
This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
---
## Features
---
* Encryption: Encrypt your messages with a specified shift value.
* Decryption: Decrypt Caesar cipher-encrypted messages with the correct shift value.
* Support for Alphabetic Characters: Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving non-alphabet characters.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for ease of use.
---
## How to Use
---
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script:
   `python caesar-cipher-algorithm.py`
3. Enter your message when promted.
4. Enter the shift number (an integer) when prompted. The shift value should be between 0 and 25, and it can be any positive or negative integer. If the shift value is greater than 25, it wraps around the alphabet.
5. Get the result: The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.
---
## Example Usage
---
* To encrypt and decrypt a message: Input your message, and specify the shift value.
